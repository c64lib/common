/*
 * Set of KickAssembler macros for subroutine implementation.
 *
 * With these macros one can realize communication with subroutines using stack. This approach
 * is following:
 * 1) subroutine caller prepares input parameters and pushes them to the stack using push*() macros
 * 2) subroutine is then called using JSR
 * 3) subroutine first preserves return address in local variable using invokeStackBegin(variablePtr) macro
 * 4) subroutine then pulls all pushed parameters in opposite order using pull*() macros
 * 5) when subroutine is about to end, just before RTS is called, it must restore return address with invokeStackEnd(varPtr) macro
 *
 * Requires KickAssembler v4.x
